2571 LANG "You have completed the tutorial Now it's time to start Thermonuclear War!"
2570 LANG "A lot of different events will be happening almost simultaneously, so it makes sense to put the Journal into the Nuclear War mode, meaning the game will not auto-pause anymore.\n\nClick the Nuclear War Mode button, then unpause the game and watch your units bring death and destruction to your enemy!"
2569 LANG "Upause the game to continue."
2568 LANG "Now click the Execute \"Plan Alpha\" to let your carriers disarm the enemy."
2567 LANG "Your bombers are now close enough to enemy territory, now it's time to disable the enemy's defences.\n\nWhile the time to execute your Plan Alpha is significantly shorter than the remaining time to Armageddon, you should expect your enemy to notice your mass attack, so it's better to disable him beforehand."
2566 LANG "You can see your missile silos and SSBNs went into Wait mode, while your airbases are flushing the bombers.\n\nUnpause the game to continue."
2565 LANG "Note that Armageddon plan is longer set to execute - this is because it takes a significant time for all bombers to leave air bases and reach their targets.\n\nNow click the Execute \"Plan Armageddon\" option - this will trigger the attack."
2564 LANG "There are two icons representing your strike plans in the bottom left of the screen.\n\nEach icon has the execution time printed on it - this is the time required for the last warheads to reach selected targets.\n\nYou may hover your mouse over the plan icon to read it."
2563 LANG "Plan Armageddon is planned, now it's time to execute!\n\nClick OK button to close the Strike Planner."
2562 LANG "And finally, assign this plan a new icon - click the Radiation icon in the top left corner of the Strike Planner window."
2561 LANG "Select SSBN, Air base and Missile silo as Attackers and then City as a Target."
2560 LANG "Now let's create another strike plan, this time for your Strategic Nuclear Forces!\n\nClick on the \"New Strike Plan\" button."
2559 LANG "The Faction column allows you to limit your attack to  specific regional targets only.\n\nThe settings row outlines the details of the strike plan.\n\nAuto Continue means your units will continue selecting and attacking new targets after the initial strike plan is executed.\n\nSynchronize Attack means all attacking units are to coordinate their actions.\n\nTimed Destruction means your units will time their attack to land the warheads on all selected targets almost simultaneously.\n\nClick OK button to finalize your Plan Alpha."
2558 LANG "Now click on the SAM site icon and then click on it again - this will make it the secondary Target."
2557 LANG "The middle column lists the unit types your attackers should consider - the Targets.\n\nClick on the Air base, Missile silo and Over-the-horizon radar icons. This will tell your carrier groups to primarily target these unit types."
2556 LANG "This screen allows you to automate a massive strike.\n\nThe left column lists the unit types you can guide - the Attackers.\n\nClick on the Carrier icon to plan the actions for your carrier groups."
2555 LANG "To avoid micro-managing dozens of units, you have the Strike Planner.\n\nClick on the \"New Strike Plan\" button in the bottom left corner of the screen."
2554 LANG "In this scenario you have carrier groups that are to deal with the enemy's defences and attack capabilities.\n\nThen you have your own missile silos, nuclear subs and strategic bombers to level  the enemy cities."
2553 LANG "Now let's play Armageddon!\n\nIf you want to score more in the game, you need to execute a massive nuclear strike on the enemy while ensuring he is not able to respond. This requires the precise timing and coordination between your units."
2552 LANG "Mission 7 completed.\n\nClick OK to move on to Mission 8."
2551 LANG "Destroy the highlighted objects with nuclear strikes!\nBetter to target all three enemy ICBM Vehicles simultaneously to avoid the retaliation strike."
2550 LANG "Deploy your Satellite so that its traverse path covers the centers of highlighted areas.\n\nScroll the map to alter the Satellite path or switch to the Globe View if necessary."
2549 LANG "Now build you first Satellite!"
2548 LANG "You can choose how the effort is distributed between Construction and Science. Placing more effort into one category makes another one weaker.\n\nNow unpause the game and wait until the Satellite is available."
2547 LANG "This is the Science tree. Each technology gives you new unit types or some upgrades, but takes some time to research and you rarely have enough time to discover more than one third of the tree, so choose wisely!\n\nScroll down the Science Tree and click on the Satellite technology."
2546 LANG "OK, we will have some Missiles soon, but we need to know our targets. One of the best ways to spy on the enemy is to launch a Satellite, but we need to discover this technology first.\n\nClick the New Research button."
2545 LANG "Each unit takes some time to build, so you need to plan your construction to have enough units and missiles available when you need them. However you can modify the Construction queue. Clicking on the queued unit removes it from the queue, but Shift+click moves item to the head of the queue.\n\nMove the ICBM to the head of the queue."
2544 LANG "Each Missile Silo comes with one nuclear missile (of the latest generation) already included, but we will need more, so let's build one additional missile.\n\nNote that the nuclear bombs and missiles are very expensive to build in the beginning of the game - pay attention to the Warhead production efficiency value before queueing some!\nThe efficiency constantly goes up as your technology develops and will reach 100% at approximately 2:00.00 in-game time - then you can quickly build a great stock of the nukes.\n\nNow switch to the Missiles category and add one Megaton ICBM."
2543 LANG "This screen gives you control over your Production, Research and Espionage.\n\nTo place a unit into the Construction Queue, simply click on one of the unit icons in the right part of your screen. Currently only Ground units are listed, but later you can also choose from different categories.\n\nAdd three Missile Silos to the Construction Queue."
2542 LANG "Now it is time to build some units!\n\nClick the Construction / Science / Espionage button on the control panel or press L key."
2541 LANG "Mission 6 completed.\n\nClick OK to move on to Mission 7."
2540 LANG "The ICBM has been detected by your Over-the-horizon Radar! South Asia is attacking our cities! We can do nothing about the missiles, but we can prevent more launches.\n\nUse your nuclear submarine to destroy the enemy Missile Silos.\n\nYour submarine cannot launch its missiles when under the water.\nSelect the SSBN, click the Surface button and then unpause the game for your Submarine to execute the Surface order."
2539 LANG "Attack the submarine!"
2538 LANG "There are two enemy Submarines hidden off the West Coast of America. Send your Destroyers to search for them.\n\nSearching for submarines can be tedious, as the detection range of the Sonar is quite limited and you need to cover a large area of the ocean.\n\nTo automate things, set the Move Pattern. Select the Destroyer fleet, then hold the Shift key and make several clicks in zig-zag pattern along the coast.\n\nIf you finish the Move Pattern clicking at one of the intermediate waypoints, it will become the Patrol Route and your ship will be following that until you cancel her orders."
2537 LANG "Each Nuclear Submarine carry twelve Medium Range nukes. While a Submarine stays underwater she is very difficult to find, so it can quietly approach the enemy coast and destroy the enemy infrastructure or you can run up your score by nuking the cities.\n\nSend your Submarine fleet close to the China coast."
2536 LANG "We are also going to use our own SSBN to obliterate the East Coast of China in retaliation.\n\nCreate a fleet of the Nuclear Submarine supported by the Attack Submarine and deploy it."
2535 LANG "So far we've been operating out of Europe, however this will not always be the case.\n\nIn this mission you are playing for North America and the enemy is South Asia.\n\nThe enemy has positioned a number of Nuclear Submarines off the West Coast of America. From there they will be able to nuke any target on your territory.\n\nThe best weapon against enemy submarines is the Destroyer - it can track them under water using sonar and then close in and destroy the enemy.\n\nDeploy two fleets of Destroyers off your West Coast."
2534 LANG "Mission 5 completed.\n\nClick OK to move on to Mission 6."
2533 LANG "Your fleets will engage the enemy automatically, however you can also guide them manually for more effective attack."
2532 LANG "It can take a while for your fleet to reach the destination point, so you can increase the time flow using the Time Controls.\n\nThe Time Controls are located in the bottom right corner of the screen. The game can run in real-time, x3, x6 or x20 speed - this is selected by the Speed Segments.\nAlternatively use 1,2,3,4 keys to select the game speed."
2531 LANG "The ship can leave a fleet, rejoing that fleet  or join another fleet at any time. To leave a fleet select the ship and cancel her orders. To join a fleet, give the ship the Follow order.\n\nThe keyboard shortcut for the Move order is Shift, for the Follow order - Alt, for the Attack order - Ctrl."
2530 LANG "Fleets can be controlled as a single unit. You give orders to the flagship only and the others in the same fleet will be following the flagship.\nAlternatively you can double-click on any ship of the fleet to select the whole fleet.\n\nSend your carrier groups to the highlighted zones - right-clicking gives the target-dependend order."
2529 LANG "Carriers act as mobile Airbase, allowing you to launch Attack Bombers and Fighters.\n- Destroyers are fast ships with good air defence (and later - anti-missile) abilities.\n- Cruisers are strong all-around performers that can carry tactical Nukes, but are expensive and more vulnerable to air attacks.\n\nNow build and deploy the second fleet."
2528 LANG "Your naval forces are stronger when they are grouped in fleets.\nThe fleet is centered around one flag ship with other ships following her.\n\nTo build a fleet, first click on the Carrier icon, (she will be the flag ship) then continue with adding two Destroyers and one Cruiser by clicking on them. Then deploy the fleet in your waters."
2527 LANG "Mission 4 completed.\n\nClick OK to move on to Mission 5."
2526 LANG "Now order your Airbase to attack the Missile Silo.\n\nKeep searching for the second Missile Silo and be aware of the enemy fighters!"
2525 LANG "Now you can use your bombers to attack the enemy Silo.\n\nThe underground Missile Silo is a reinforced object, so it can take quite a long time to destroy it with conventional weapons.\nLoad your bombers with the Nuclear bomb by clicking on the bomb icon below the Bomber in the Airbase control window and choosing the Nuclear Bomb config."
2524 LANG "Note that the enemy Missile Silo is well within the radar range of your aircraft, but has been detected only now. This is because some units are harder to detect - Missile Silos are camouflaged and underground, Stealth aircraft dissipate radar waves, Silent Engines of the submarines limit their visibility to sonars."
2523 LANG "Switch on the Radar Coverage mode to better understand what territory is observed by your units. \nThis can be done by clicking on the Radar Coverage button on the Control Panel in the lower right corner of the screen. Alternatively, press R button to switch the Radar Coverage on and off."
2522 LANG "Launch one of your AWACS to scout the enemy territory.\n\nYou can switch to the Launch mode either by clicking on the AWACS icon or holding the 'C' key. 'Z' corresponds to Fighters, 'X' - to Bombers.\n\nWhen you switch to the Launch mode you can see the two ranges - Safe Range and the Maximum Range.\nSafe Range shows the territory your aircraft can reach and then safely return to the home Airbase."
2521 LANG "Your Airbases can launch three types of aircraft:\nFighters : short range combat planes\nBombers : long range aircraft capable of carrying nuclear weapons\nAEW&C aircraft : the long range airborne radar (available with the specific technology)\n\nYou can launch any of your aircraft to scout enemy territory but AWACS make the best scouts."
2520 LANG "In many cases enemy units will be out of your Radar range or just well camouflaged (like the undeground missile silos). To survey the enemy territory you can use your air forces.\n\nPlace some Airbases in your territory."
2519 LANG "Knowing where your enemy has deployed his units is crucial for winning!\nHowever, there is no universal radar in the game:\n- Long Wave radar is good for detecting units at the long range, but does not give the precision required to fire anything but the Nuclear Weapon. And it cannot see flying nukes until it is too late!\n- Short Wave radar gives the precision to fire the conventional guided missiles, but it has the very limited range.\n- Over-the-horizon radar can be used to detect the enemy nukes from a great distance, but it cannot see anything else.\n\nMission 3 is completed.\n\nClick OK to move on to Mission 4."
2518 LANG "Destroy the enemy air bases using nuclear weapons.\n\nNote that the bases are protected by the SAM sites, so you need to saturate enemy defences to succeed."
2517 LANG "Note that your MRBMs have not only a maximum attack range, but also minimum. So you should not place them too close to the borders or your will not be able to attack the targets."
2516 LANG "You can now see the enemy units.\n\nDeploy your MRBM vehicles to destroy the enemy."
2515 LANG "Now unpause the game to see the effect from your Radars."
2514 LANG "Position your Radars as close to the Russian border as possible, to look further inside Russian territory."
2513 LANG "The enemy units are invisible unless they are in the range of one of your radars.\n\nThere are several enemy units hidden on Russian territory, deploy your Radars to find them."
2512 LANG "Mission 2 completed.\n\nClick OK to move on to Mission 3."
2511 LANG "Enemy submarines have launched nukes at your cities!\nYour SAM sites will exert maximum effort to intercept the incoming missiles.\n\nUnpause the game to continue."
2510 LANG "You may only deploy your units within your own territory, that is marked by your color (green in this case). Ground units are to be deployed on land, while the naval units are to be deployed on water.\n\nDeploy your SAM sites to protect your major cities like London, Paris and Madrid.\n\nHold SHIFT to deploy several units."
2509 LANG "Before you can command your units, you need to deploy them. The units available for deployment are listed in the left part of the screen.\n\nClick the SAM site icon to deploy it."
2508 LANG "Mission 1 completed.\n\nClick OK to move on to Mission 2."
2507 LANG "Continue by unpausing the game."
2506 LANG "Each order takes time to execute. Note the attack countdown in the list of the Current Orders in the Unit Control window."
2505 LANG "The Events Journal is a very important part of the game interface. All kinds of in-game events are registered there and any one of these events can automatically pause the game.\nThere are more than 50 event types in the game and in the Events Journal you can set the desired reaction to these events according to your own game style.\n\nWhen the Journal appears you have three possible actions - move to the event source (click on the message text or hit 'Enter'), close the Journal leaving the game on Pause (hit the 'Escape' key or 'Close' button), or ignore the event, which closes the Journal and continues the game ('Space' bar, the time button or the 'close and continue' button).\n\nNow the Journal informs us that the target was destroyed. Unpause the game to continue."
2504 LANG "You have just given the orders to your unit, but nothing happens because the game is on pause.\n\nThe Time Controls are located in the bottom right corner of the screen. The game can run in real-time, x3, x6 or x20 speed - this is selected by the Speed Segments.\nPause or unpause the game by clicking the center of the Time Controls.\n\nAlternatively use the SPACE key to pause/unpause and 1,2,3,4 keys to select the game speed.\n\nUnpause the game to continue."
2503 LANG "In the bottom left corner you can now see the Unit Control window.\nIt shows the essential information about the selected unit - the weapon it has, it's basic characteristics like speed and range, the radars it is equipped with, etc.\nWhen some unit is selected you can also see several related ranges - in our case there is the Attack range - it can be toggled by clicking on the weapon icon at the unit control window.\n\nNow attack the enemy radars! You can do it by simply left clicking on them."
2502 LANG "The highlighted unit is the Mobile MRBM Vehicle. It can be used to destroy the nearby enemy Radars.\n\nSelect the unit by left-clicking on it."
2501 LANG "First you need to learn how to control your viewpoint.\n\nYou can scroll it either by moving the cursor to the edge of the screen in the direction you want to move, or by left-clicking and holding the left mouse button down on any point on the map while dragging the map.\nThe map can be scaled either by scrolling the mouse wheel, or by hitting the '+' and '-' keys.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the W.A.S.D keys to move your viewpoint and Q and E keys for zooming.\n\nClick OK when you get comfortable with the viewpoint controls."

Over-The-Horizon radar is the primary mean of missile detection and tracking. The conventional radars have too short of a range and are not suited to tracking targets flying high in space, so they usually fail to give your anti-missile defence sufficient time to react to the threat."
